    <h1>Peer Mentoring</h1>

    <section class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            Doing Peer Mentoring at Sequoia Middle School was a blessing in disguise,
            not being a fluent Hmong speaker myself, I didn't know what to expect.

    <h2>Why Peer Mentoring?</h2>

    <section class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            Being here for nearly two years, I fell in love with the idea of growing
            and building friendly and academic relationships with students. There was
            absolutely nothing else I wanted but to serve this small, underserved
            community. To see these middle schoolers succeed was the key to my own
            success.

    <h2>My Closing Thoughts</h2>

    <section class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            Having fun was part of the journey too, with ups and downs with the handling
            of middle school students. I absolutely loved working for Fresno Unified School
            District's Peer Mentoring Program.

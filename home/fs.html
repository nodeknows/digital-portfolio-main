                    Being apart of Fresno State's Upward Bound Program, we were
                    placed in residential dorms over the summer. Many of us came
                    from a similar background, allowing us to form strong connections
                    very quickly!

                    We had went to several trips throughout our 6-week stay at Fresno State,
                    including this one in San Diego, California! This picture was taken at a
                    local hotel, a day before we went out to San Diego State and UC San Diego.

                    Fresno State's Upward Bound Program prioritizes the experience of the
                    learning and the students themselves. In this picture they had thrown a
                    surprise glow-in-the-dark party a week before the the program ended!

                    Meeting people like me made this experience awesome, interesting, and
                    created a learning experience like no other. It was amazing being at
                    different college campuses, taking Fresno State college classes, and
                    building long-lasting relationships!

                    I started an internship through the Upward Bound Program within the
                    Athletics & Marketing department, here at Fresno State. It was very
                    rigorous, with heavy usage of software and electronic devices.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Being sent to presentations multiple times a week, we had many learning
                    opportunities and professional development days. This really helped me
                    ease into this internship, my first!
                </p>

            <img src="../imgs/fs_stadium.jpg" alt="">
            <div>
                <p>
                    At the Fresno State's Athletics Ticketing Department, their facility was right
                    within this stadium. Their work environment was significantly more peaceful
                    and we learned to control ticket distribution and customer service! Hint:
                    me and my internship partner had been offered a part-time job opportunity here!

                <p>
                    Showing up to these internship opportunities were life-changing and it set the
                    course to the career path of technology for me. Being able to understand that research
                    is the true work, it allowed me to create foundations for my work ethic. Being in a 
                    professional environment was what set me up for success!
